## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I dived into CSS Grid and Flexbox which helped me to rearrange sections. It was more enjoyable 
to control and manipulate layout with confidance and theoretical basis. 

### Continued development

I definitely need to learn a lot and sharpen my skills about "Mobile First" development which is new for me.
Also, proper Html markup and flat code will be my future goal.

I mostly used Grid system but Flexbox was usefull time to time.

## Acknowledgments
